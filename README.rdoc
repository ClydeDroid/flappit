== Flappit

A fully functional Reddit clone built using Rails and Angular. Based heavily on the guide at https://thinkster.io/angular-rails, I added my own spin by
using Slim for HTML templates and by only allowing each user to post once.

You can check it out by going to http://flappit.herokuapp.com/ or by cloning this repo, running <tt>rake db:create</tt> and <tt>rake db:migrate</tt>, and starting up a server.
