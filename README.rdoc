== Flappit

A fully functional Reddit clone built using Rails and Angular. Based heavily on the guide at https://thinkster.io/angular-rails, I added my own spin by
using Slim for HTML templates and by only allowing each user to post once.

You can check it out by going to http://flappit.herokuapp.com. Or if you're feeling adventurous, clone this repo and run:

* <tt>bundle install</tt>
* <tt>rake bower:install</tt>
* <tt>rake db:create</tt>
* <tt>rake db:migrate</tt>
* <tt>rails server</tt>
